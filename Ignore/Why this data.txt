In this folder you will find three files:

1. Airfares
	These are non-seasonally adjusted airfares with consistent and reliable data from 1969 onwards. The reason it is non-seasonally adjusted is because the seasonally adjusted variant of the data is only available from 1989 onwards, removing 20 years of valuable information.

2. CPI
	This is CPI for all urban consumers: All item US city average. Maybe it should be CPI less energy.

3. WTI
	This is West Texas Intermediate oil price, which tracks the price of a barrel of light oil.
